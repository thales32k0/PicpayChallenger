This project demonstrates the creation of a complete application in Java, using the following technologies:

- JPA: object-relational mapping for data persistence in H2.
- Spring Web: development of RESTful APIs with a focus on simplicity and flexibility.
- RESTful API: communication interface with the application, following the best practices of REST architecture.
- H2 Database: in-memory database, ideal for testing and rapid development.
